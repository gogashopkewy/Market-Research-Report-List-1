<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Pumps for Medical Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Displacement</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vacuum pumps in the medical market primarily include positive displacement pumps and centrifugal pumps. Positive displacement pumps work by trapping a fixed volume of air or gas and then expelling it, providing a reliable and consistent vacuum level. They are commonly used for applications requiring precise control, such as suction devices. In contrast, centrifugal pumps generate a vacuum by imparting kinetic energy to the gas, suitable for high-flow applications but may lack the same precision. Each type serves specific medical functions based on operational needs.</p></p>
