<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical High Frequency Electrosurgical Knife Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar</li><li>Bipolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The surgical high-frequency electrosurgical knife market is divided into monopolar and bipolar types. Monopolar electrosurgery uses a single electrode to deliver high-frequency current, effective for cutting and coagulation, while the return electrode is placed on the patient’s body. In contrast, bipolar electrosurgery utilizes two electrodes in close proximity, allowing current to flow between them, making it more precise and minimizing surrounding tissue damage. Both types cater to different surgical needs and preferences in the medical field.</p></p>
